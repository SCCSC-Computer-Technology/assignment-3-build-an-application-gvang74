Initially, I was unsure which branch I was supposed to use.

Patch-2 is in a completely broken state. I was unable to even view the form's UI design, much less run it.
In light of this, this review is based on patch-1.

The form loads, but requires pressing the 'Export' button and manually selecting the included States excel
sheet to load. This is fine, but that's not what Export means. The button should be labeled Import. It took me
reading through the code to get this right, because there are no comments in the code or explanation on the
form itself. That said, I have no complaints about the manual import. It works, and is likely more reliable than
an automatic approach.

I am unsure what library the user created, if any. If the library for interacting with Excel files is not the
user's, it does at least look interesting, and I would like to learn more about it in my free time.

The search function is interesting. The label explaining how to use it was enough for me to understand, but it
could afford to be more verbose, because I'm not entirely sure if less savvy users could comprehend it.

The combo box has not been set up at all. It might have been nice as a drop-down menu of states.

There's no explanation for what the 'OverallWorkforce' or 'JobPosting' columns represent. There are multiple ways
to potentially interpret the numbers given.

There is an unused method in Form1's code and a completely unused Form3. Form2 also seems to be unused despite having
code, since it isn't called from Form1. I also feel like, in place of or supplementary to comments, more verbose naming
conventions could have been used.
