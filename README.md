Assignment Information
Instructions
You have been tasked with building an application that will serve as a system for a company’s state database program. Your data must store all the states of the United States. It must store each state’s name, population, state flag, state flower, state bird, colors, the three largest cities, and the state capital. It will also tell you the median income for that state, and the percentage of computer-related jobs offered in that state. Your software application should be able to insert all the data into a database, given some type of input medium. It must allow the user to select the state from a dropdown. It must then show the state details on a separate page. Furthermore, it must also be able to search, sort, update, and filter the data in all the columns for each state. Create a C# application that contains a database connection, a class library, and a windows forms project. Your program should be able to be run and navigated, with clear instructions and proper error messages where applicable. Also, make sure to have the correct exception errors in case of bad input by the users. 

I honestly don't know what I am doing at this point.
I had to start over on the project/homework at least 6 times. 
I started with Access Database and it was working fine at the beginning but after working on the code for each object my Access Data would not connect anymore.

I don't know what I did. But I spent hours and hours teying to figure. I'm done. :(

So I went back and start an application program using an Excel Database. Program was up and run but when I stop to upload it to gitHub. It kept tell me my file was too big. I start uploading a few file at a time and i lost my form1.cs and form2.cs.

This was fun at the beginning but now I am just over it.
Sorry. But I am just turning in what I have.
